### Loading custom javascript & css
NOPE, Vue won't run scripts it'll only show them in console:

---Add the following to the `style` section of your storysynth:
---`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickpunt/storysynth/main/colony/storysynth.js"></script>`
---This will add js & css from this github. The page will probably flash due to the style repainting with the addition of new css.
