### Loading custom javascript & css
Add the following to the `style` section of your storysynth:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickpunt/storysynth/main/colony/storysynth.js"></script>`

This will add js & css from this github. The page will probably flash due to the style repainting with the addition of new css.
